        "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best—and most grueling—time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

I often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
